# Text Classification using TensorFlow

## Project Overview
This project implements a text classification model using TensorFlow to classify messages as spam or non-spam (ham). The dataset used contains SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. The model achieves high accuracy on the test set, making it suitable for real-world spam detection applications.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** `spam.csv`  
- The dataset contains SMS messages with two labels:  
  - `spam` (unwanted messages)  
  - `ham` (normal messages)  
- The dataset consists of over 5,000 messages (adjust if your dataset size differs).

## Features
- Text preprocessing including tokenization and padding  
- Neural network model built with TensorFlow/Keras  
- Model evaluation and accuracy reporting  
- Exporting model for future use

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sathvika1507/TextClassificationProject.git
   cd TextClassificationProject
  




## Results
- The model achieved **97.49%** accuracy on the test set.
- Confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics are printed during execution.

## File Descriptions
- `text_classification.py` - Main Python script for model training and evaluation  
- `spam.csv` - Dataset file containing SMS messages and labels  
- `Project_Report.pdf` - Detailed project report describing methodology, results, and conclusions  
- `README.md` - Project documentation and instructions

## Future Work
- Improve model performance with hyperparameter tuning  
- Deploy the model as a web service or mobile app  
- Experiment with more advanced NLP techniques like transformers
